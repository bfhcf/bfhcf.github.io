                    <p class="wow fadeInUp animation-delay-9">March 15, 2020, when our Government declared the first-ever lockdown in Metro Manila and placed the area of over 12 million people in a state of community quarantine. Two days after, a stricter measure, the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), was implemented over the island of Luzon, including its associated islands.</p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp animation-delay-11">Before that, as the assigned pastor, I made a plan on what to do. Then the lockdown came! I was baffled and did not know what to do. No matter how good my schedule was, I could not implement it. Being a doer person, I was at a loss.</p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp animation-delay-13">So, I find myself praying and asking GOD what He wants me to do. That's when the 5-minute came to my mind. Its only purpose is to walk a 5-minute Journey with the LORD during this pandemic. As we journey with the LORD, the 5-minute Journey looks at the events and issues related to COVID-19. With the Bible as the guide and source of strength and wisdom, it could minister throughout one year.</p>
