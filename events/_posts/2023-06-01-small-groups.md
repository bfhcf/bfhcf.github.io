Are you a part of the different small groups of the church? Today is your opportunity to be a part of one! The church has different small groups for the members and worshipers of Bread From Heaven. These small groups allow us to grow in our walk with the Lord, as well as in fellowship and accountability. We are inviting those who do not have small groups to sign up outside after the service. The pastors, elders, deacons, and ministry leads will helping you in finding the right where you can grow, be strengthened, and be a blessing to others.
