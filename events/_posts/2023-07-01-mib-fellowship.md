We’d like to remind our men that the next MIB Fellowship will be on July 15 at 7 AM here at our church grounds. We are inviting our men to sharpen one another in fellowship and in study of God’s Word as we fulfill our role that God has given to us as heads of our household. Please contact Gerry Punsal and Pastor Vic San Juan for details on how to join.
