The church continues to do Godâ€™s call to care for one another especially at this time. We are still accepting donations for hygiene kits for the members and worshippers in need. We are inviting the families of the church to donate the following: bath soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, alcohol or hand sanitizers and face masks. You may also want to include a biblical verse or two to encourage them. The church staff will be welcoming your donations so please get in touch with them through our church administrator, Dra. Cora Santiago.
