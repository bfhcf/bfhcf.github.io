Coming from Women of Bread or WOMB, on February 11 and February 12 after our 10:30 AM service, we will be having a rummage sale that will be held here in our church grounds. For those who will be donating clothes and other items, we will start receiving them until February 8.
For any questions and inquiries, please do look for Sis. Alma Caminade and the WOMB Core.
