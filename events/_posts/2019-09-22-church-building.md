We are blessed that the church continues to be a testimony of Godâ€™s
faithfulness to the community around us. That is why the pastors and
Consistory of the church are reminding everyone to continue to pray that
God in His right time will lead us to begin construction of the new church
sanctuary.

Please visit the church website to see the details on the planned
construction, and if the Lord is leading you to give, please deposit to RCBC
as the primary account for the Church Building Fund.
Join us in earnest prayer so that through this project we can continue to
proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ to our communities and be a channel of
blessing to those around us.
