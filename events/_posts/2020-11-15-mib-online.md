Calling all men of the church! Youâ€™re invited to attend the next early morning MIB fellowship on November 21st 7am. 

This will be a great way for the men to gather in fellowship and prayer for our families and for the church. This is being done via Zoom, and it is open to men of all ages. 

Please contact Bro. Henry Go and Pastor Vic San Juan for details on how to join.
