We’d like to remind our Cluster 2 members that your incoming year end fellowship and Bible study will be held here at church on November 27 at 5PM. We encourage you to join and be filled with the knowledge of God’s word and be blessed by fellowshipping with our brothers and sisters in Christ. For more information, please do contact Ptr. Vic San Juan, our Cluster 2 pastor.
