For our dear parents, we are announcing the return of our Sunday School classes! So we are inviting you to bring your kids from Preschool to High School so they can know more about our God through our different activities and lessons. We also have brochures outside that you can pick up after our services. If you want to know more, please contact Sis. Daisy Miguel and Sis. Cecel Mando â€“ Arisgado.
