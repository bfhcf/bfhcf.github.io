October is the opportunity for us as a church to celebrate the goodness and faithfulness of our God. We will be having a double month-long celebration of the Reformation month with different activities as part of our Sunday services. Our anniversary service will be on October 30th, 9 AM. Please note that there will only be one service on that day, so we are inviting everyone to attend in person and online for thanksgiving to our faithful and loving God.
