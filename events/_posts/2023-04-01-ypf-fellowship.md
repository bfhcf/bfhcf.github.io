The next fellowship for our young people or the YPF will be on Saturday, April 15 and 29, 7pm. We will also be having dinner by 6pm. For all our young people ages 15 and up, we invite you to disconnect online, and join your fellow young people face to face as we continue to learn more about our Lord Jesus Christ and how we can live as Godly young people today. To know more please contact Pastor Kyle Quevedo and the YPF Core.
