Our church Bread From Heaven Christian Fellowship, in partnership with the BF Federation of Homeowners Association Inc., or BFFHAI, will be hosting an online webinar entitled “What You Need To Know About COVID-19 Vaccines.” This will be on March 12, Friday, 7pm, and will also be simulcast on our church Facebook page and YouTube channel.

Our speaker will be Dr. Anna Lisa T. Ong-Lim of the DOH Technical Advisory Group. She is also a UP College of Medicine professor and President of the the Philippine Infectious Diseases Society from 2018 - 2020.

She will be joined by the City Health of Paranaque's Medical Team: Dr. Romher Tobias Supangan, head of Health Promotion and Communications Unit, and Dra. Crislyn Joy S. Mendoza of Health Emergency Management Services. Mayor Olivarez of Paranaque will also share his message before the event.

This is a good opportunity for us to learn about the different vaccines available to battle COVID-19, and to know the details of the vaccination program prepared by the City government of Paranaque.
