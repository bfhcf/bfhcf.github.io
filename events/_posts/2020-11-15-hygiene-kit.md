This is a special announcement we are opening to everyone. The Missions Ministry of Bread From Heaven Christian Fellowship is running a donation drive to collect personal hygiene kits for the homeless and the needy who cannot afford to buy hygiene products. With Covid-19 hitting a lot of people hard with regards to health and finances, these health hygiene products are more crucial than ever. 

In this regard, we would like to enjoin the covenant families in BFHCF to donate hygiene kits to the needy. The kit will include the following: toothbrush, toothpaste, bath soap, shampoo, alcohol or hand sanitizer, face masks and face shields. To encourage the recipient, you may want to include a small note containing a Biblical passage. 

We will be putting boxes at the church where you can deposit your donations. Please contact our church staff for details and assistance.
