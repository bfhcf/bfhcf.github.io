Also for the teens, we have a Music Intensive Training, or MINT, program, that is done in collaboration with the Music Ministry. Parents for children ages 12 – 17, we are opening this program for your child who may be interested to learn piano, voice, guitar, drums and violin.

There are only 5 slots available for each instrument, and the fee will cover the lessons that will be done online. We encourage your child  to join and utilize the gifts that God has given to them.

For all these activities please contact the Teens core, Sis. Cecel Mando – Arisgado, and Sis. Daisy Miguel, so you can participate in fellowship.
