For all the women of the church, the next fellowship of the Women of Bread or WOMB will be on Saturday, September 30, 10 AM. The fellowship will focus on the topic of ‘Single and Widows of Substance – I will choose to find joy in the journey that God has set before me’.
The theme verse is coming from Psalm 35:27 and our speaker will be Sis. Janet Brambilla and Ptr. Abel Salamat.
We are inviting all the women of the church to register outside after the service. We also encourage you to join the different small groups of the WOMB to strengthen each other. Please look for the WOMB Core and Sis. Winnie Dumlao if you would like to join the WOMB small groups.
