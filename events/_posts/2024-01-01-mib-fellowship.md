The next fellowship for the Men in Bread or MIB will be on Saturday, January
20th, 8am. The fellowship will be the introduction for the new book of Pastor
Vic San Juan, “Losing Spiritual Vitality”. Aside from this there will also be a
free checkup and presentation on hypertension and stroke from Dra. AJ San
Juan – Garcia.

This fellowship is open to all, not just the men of the church! We encourage
you to register outside after the service. To know more contact the MIB Core,
Pastor Vic and Bro. Gerry Punsal.
