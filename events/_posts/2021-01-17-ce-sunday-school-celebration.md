We praise God for all those who have joined the home based Sunday school program, and to close the program, we have a planned online celebration!

This is our way to praise God for the parents and guardians who gave their precious time share the love of Jesus to their children, and the point persons who volunteered their time to distribute and collect materials.

The celebration will be on Friday, March 5th, 4pm via Zoom.
