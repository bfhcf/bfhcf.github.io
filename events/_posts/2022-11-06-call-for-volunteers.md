Bread From Heaven is inviting all our members and worshipers to serve our God through the different ministries of the church. We are looking for volunteers to help in our Music, Multimedia and Church Greeters for both online and face to face services. We are also inviting you to serve in the Christian Education ministry and in our family ministries. To know more, please contact the ministry leads or our Pastors. We pray that this year will be your opportunity to worship God through our various ministries.
