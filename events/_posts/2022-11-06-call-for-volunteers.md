As the different ministries of the church resume their activities, we are
inviting everyone to serve the Lord in the different ministries that you see at
the church. The ministries of the church are for the married, young and old,
music and multimedia, missions, and many more. We pray that you will use
the skills and abilities God has given you to serve Him. Get in touch with our
ministry leads and pastors if you would like to serve in the various ministries.
