Also this coming December, the different ministries will be having various online fellowships as thanksgiving to God for 2020. Please contact the different ministry leads and core groups for the details on how to join these as well as in our weekly schedules.Our weekly schedules and classes are made for us to fellowship and to help in our spiritual growth, so you are all invited to attend these.  We look forward to seeing you in all these fellowships, which you can see on our Facebook page, and at the revamped BFHCF website.
