Before we go to our other activities we would like to give this special announcement:

On November 12, Typhoon Ulysses battered widespread areas of the Philippines including Calabarzon, Bicol, National Capital Region, Central Luzon, Cagayan Region and Cordillera Region leaving several communities flooded and homes destroyed. 

Bread From Heaven Christian Fellowship through the Missions Ministry is appealing to all its members for prayers and cash donations to provide relief goods to the victims who are still struggling at this time. Whatever amount you can give will help buy food (rice, canned food, milk, bottled water etc.). The relief goods will be delivered by our mission partner, The Center for Community Transformation directly to the victims of this calamity.

The Bible says, “Bear one another’s burden, and so fulfill the law of Christ” Galatians 6:2.

Those who wish to donate in cash may send them through our church bank accounts, please indicate in the transfer details that this is for the donations drive. You can see once more our church account numbers by [clicking this link](/give/online-banking). For those who wish to donate items in kind please coordinate with our church staff through our administrator Dra. Cora Santiago. 

To God be the glory!
