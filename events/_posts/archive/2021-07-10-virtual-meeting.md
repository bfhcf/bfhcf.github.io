We praise our God for His continuous faithfulness to Bread From Christian Fellowship and throughout all the operations of the churcheven in the midst of the pandemic. That is why we are inviting all the members of the church in good standing to a special online meeting on Sunday, July 18. This will be at 9:30 â€“ 10:30am, and we will be sending further details to you. Please take note, that this will only be open to members of good standing of the church, as well as their families. We hope to see you there.
