Blessed morning to everyone! On December 20, Bread From Heaven Christian Fellowship will be celebrating its anniversary and Christmas presentation entitled “Rejoicing Comes In the Morning.” The anniversary service will be done online on December 20, 10 am. We will not be having services at 8:30 and 10:30 am, so it will just be one service on that day. Join us as we celebrate the Lord’s goodness and faithfulness to us as a church and in the lives of our individual services.
