We praise God that even in the time of the pandemic the Music Intensive Training orMINT was done online for some of our young people. We thank God also for all the teachers who gave time to teach them. The MINT will be having their graduation recital on June 6th, 3pm, and we are inviting everyone to watch their performances. We hope this will also serve as an encouragement for parents to let their children join future MINT classes. The graduation will be broadcast on the churchâ€™s Facebookand YouTube channels, so we encourage you to join back online after our Sunday services on June 6.
