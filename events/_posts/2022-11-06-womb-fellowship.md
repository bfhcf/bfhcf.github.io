On November 12, the Women of Bread or WOMB will have their next fellowship to be held here in our church sanctuary. Taken from Philippians 4:4-7, the topic is — “Choose Joy” and the speaker will be Sis. Merlyn Guillermo, a family & marriage counselor, author, and host. We hope to see you there to be strengthened with the word of God and be encouraged and blessed with the presence of one another. Again, please save the date. November 12 at 9:30 AM. For more details please do contact the WOMB Core and Sis. Winnie Dumlao.
