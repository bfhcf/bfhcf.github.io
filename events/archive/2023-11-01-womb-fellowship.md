For all the women of the church, the Year-End Thanksgiving Fellowship of the Women of Bread or WOMB will be on November 25, Saturday, 10 AM. The fellowship will focus on the topic of ‘With All My Heart – I Thank You’.
The theme verse is coming from Psalm 9:1 and our speaker will be Sis. Gie Salamat and Ptr. Abel Salamat.
We are inviting all the women of the church to register outside after the service. We also encourage you to join the different small groups of the WOMB to strengthen each other. Please look for the WOMB Core and Sis. Winnie Dumlao if you would like to join the WOMB small groups.
