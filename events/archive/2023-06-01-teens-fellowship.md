The next teens fellowship is scheduled for June 17th , Saturday, 12nn. The teens will continue to learn about the names of our Lord Jesus Christ, so the theme for this month will be “Jesus, Light Of The World. We encourage the parents of children ages 10 – 14 to bring them to the fellowship for worship, games, and study of God’s Word. Please contact Sis. Cecel Arisgado, Bro. Jeremy Santiago, and the Teens Core to know more.
