We are inviting everyone to join us for our weekly Wednesday prayer service. 

The prayer focus for this Wednesday will be for our hard working and dedicated Church Staff. 

We praise God for sustaining them during this pandemic, so weâ€™ll be praying for them as well as our personal and church concerns. 

The service on November 18 is at 8pm via Zoom, and the room opens as early as 7:30 pm for fellowship. 

Please contact the pastors, church staff, and the ministry leads, for the meeting ID and password to join.
