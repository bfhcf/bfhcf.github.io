Our next Teens will be on Saturday, November 19, at 2 PM to be held here at church. So, we are encouraging all our teens ages 10 to 14 to be a part of this fellowship to worship and study of God’s word. For more details, please contact Sis. Cecel Mando – Arisgado, Bro. Jeremy Santiago, and the Teens Core.
