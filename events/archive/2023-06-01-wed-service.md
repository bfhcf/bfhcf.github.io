The Wednesday Prayer Service for this month will focus on how we as a church and as a family can grow deeper in our knowledge of God our Father. Knowing more of who God is will help us in our spiritual growth and in spreading the Gospel.
We encourage everyone to join us every Wednesday night prayer as one church family to pray for Godâ€™s protection, presence, and provision, for our family and church. Our prayer service is via Zoom and we look forward to seeing you this Wednesday, June 7,  8pm, we open the room by 7:30 PM for fellowship.
