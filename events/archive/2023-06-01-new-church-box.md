As we continue on our spiritual journey, we recognize the divine guidance and will of God in rebuilding our church and revitalizing His sanctuary, solely for His glory and intended purpose. It is through His majestic presence that we are inspired to embark on this endeavor.

To support this meaningful cause, we welcome your generous contributions. You have the option to drop off your donations at the designated location, allowing your support to directly impact the progress of our church project. Alternatively, we have provided a QR code for your convenience, which enables you to explore online banking options for making your donations. Your contributions, whether in person or digitally, play a vital role in the realization of God's vision for our church and His sanctuary.
