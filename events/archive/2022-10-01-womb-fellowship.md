We praise God for all those who have attended the last WOMB fellowship. We are glad to announce that we will be having another one lined up for this month. It is important as a community of believers to rightly encourage and journey with those who are suffering from anxiety and depression. “How to Journey With Someone Who Is Depressed and Anxious” will be the title of the next WOMB fellowship, and our speaker is Dra. Jeanette Yu-Chua. The fellowship will be done online via Zoom, on Saturday, October 22, 4:30 PM.

Aside from this upcoming fellowship, please mark your calendars as well on November 12 as the Orange Team of WOMB has prepared another gathering that is open to all the women of our church, titled “Choose Joy”. Our speaker will be Sis. Merlyn Guillermo, a family and marriage counselor. We will be posting more details regarding this in the coming weeks but if you have any immediate questions or queries, please contact Sis. Winnie Dumlao and the WOMB core.
