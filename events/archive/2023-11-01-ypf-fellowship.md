The fellowships for our young people this month will be on November 11 and 25, Saturday, dinner will be served at 6 PM. For all our young people ages 15 and up, we invite you to disconnect online, and join your fellow young people face to face as we continue to learn more about our Lord Jesus Christ and how we can live as Godly young people today. For any questions or concerns, please contact our YPF Core. Do also check out and follow YPF’s Instagram account – ypf.bread to know more and be updated on our latest activities and fellowships.
