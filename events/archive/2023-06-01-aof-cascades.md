The Articles of Faith of the church are our statements of faith that define what we believe in as a church. It’s important for us to know and understand these to help us in our daily Christian walk. That’s why our pastors and leaders have scheduled cascades and lessons on the Articles of Faith, and these are open to all the members and worshipers of the church. This will start on June 13 and would continue until July 4. This will be held every Tuesday within the aforementioned dates. And so we encourage everyone to sign outside by scanning the QR code or registering after the service. Please contact Sis. Daisy Miguel and Sis. Cecel Mando – Arisgado to know more.
