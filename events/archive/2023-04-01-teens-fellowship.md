The next teens fellowship is scheduled for April 22, Saturday, 12nn. The teens will continue to learn about the names of our Lord Jesus Christ, so the theme for this month will be “Jesus The Messiah.” We encourage the parents of children ages 10 – 14 to bring them to the fellowship for worship, games, and study of God’s Word. Please contact Sis. Cecel Arisgado, Bro. Jeremy Santiago, and the Teens Core to know more.
