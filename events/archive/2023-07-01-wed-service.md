The Wednesday Prayer Service for this month will focus on why we must gather as a church, why we should not give up but encourage and strengthen each other in our journey to Christlikeness.
We encourage everyone to join us every Wednesday night prayer as one church family to pray for Godâ€™s protection, presence, and provision, for our family and church. Our prayer service is via Zoom and we look forward to seeing you this Wednesday, July 12,  8pm, we open the room by 7:30 PM for fellowship.
