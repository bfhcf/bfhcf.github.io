Calling all the women of our church. On September 24, the Women of Bread
or WOMB will have their next online fellowship. Taken from Matthew 13:18-
23, the topic is — “What is Your Label?” and the speaker will be our very own
Sis. Cathy Tan. We hope to see you there to be strengthened with the word
of God and be encouraged and blessed with the presence of one another.
Again, please save the date. September 24 at 3 PM. For more details please
do contact the WOMB Core and Sis. Winnie Dumlao.
