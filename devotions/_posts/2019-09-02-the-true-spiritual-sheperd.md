title: The True Spiritual Shepherd
author: Rev. Jeffrey Choa

Every Christian is a spiritual or a covenant shepherd. You and I, fellow members of Bread From Heaven Christian Fellowship, are all called to be spiritual or covenant shepherds. Not only pastors, consistory members, ministry overseers, or heads are shepherds but every and all Christians are spiritual or covenant shepherds.

**What is a spiritual shepherd?**

A spiritual shepherd is one who leads spiritual sheep to follow the great Shepherd, Jesus Christ.

And who or what is a spiritual sheep?

A spiritual sheep is anyone who belongs to Christ, the great shepherd. Every Christian, every believer is a spiritual sheep. Jesus Christ proclaims in John 10:11-16: 11 "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. 12 "He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. 13 "He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep. 14 "I am the good shepherd, and I know My
own and My own know Me, 15 even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. 16 "I have other sheep, which are
not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd.”
Jesus Christ is our great shepherd and we, all of us Christians, are His spiritual sheep. While we Christians are spiritual sheep, He also calls every
Christian His shepherds. Christ commands every Christian in Matthew 28:19, “Go and make disciples
of all nations...”

Likewise, all Christians are saints. This is witnessed in 1 Corinthians 1:2, “...to
those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who
in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.”

Likewise, all Christians are priests. This is witnessed in 1 Peter 2:9 and 10, “But
you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE
FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 10 for you
once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had
NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.”

Truly, all believers are disciple makers, saints, and priests. Everything we do
is worship for God. Yes—we Christians—everything we do, every relationship 
we make with other people, every conversation we make, all must be
worship for God. Truly, all Christians are spiritual shepherds.
In what way are Christians spiritual shepherds?

Every Christian is a spiritual shepherd because any adult Christian—in relating
with others according to the ways of the scripture—leads others to Christ.
Indeed, in any status and in all walks of life—even the poorest of the poor,
even a beggar on the street—if one is a true Christian and walks according
to the ways of the scripture, anyone who relates with this person may see the
image of God in him or her and may be led to the Lord. By being good or doing
good for other people and glorifying God in any way, one influences other
people. When people see Christ in them, they may turn to Christ in His will.

Likewise, if one is in any place, by behaving as unto the Lord—even when
abused—one may influence others to do good in return.

When at work, work as unto the Lord. Other co-workers may see Christ in you
and may come to Christ, as well, by God’s will.

If one is a student, study and relate with your fellow students and with your
professors as unto the Lord. One’s fellow students and professors may see
Christ in you and may come to Christ in God’s will as well.

In the same manner, if one supervises other people, relate with your
subordinates and even your own supervisor as unto the Lord.

Parents—fathers, mothers, and grandparents—you are shepherds to
your children and grandchildren. You must lead all your children and
grandchildren to Christ. Your families must be one in Christ.

In this sense, a Christian is a spiritual shepherd.

Truly, all Christians are spiritual shepherds as they may influence others to be
in Christ and to continue living in Him.

You and I, fellow Christians, must be spiritual shepherds.

Paul was a great spiritual shepherd. We can learn in Chapter 3 of 1
Thessalonians some more of the qualities of a true spiritual shepherd so that,
in learning, we model upon him.

**What are these qualities of a covenant and spiritual shepherd that we learn in
1 Thessalonians 3?**

**I. THE SPIRITUAL SHEPHERD LOVES HIS FLOCK WITH
AGAPE SACRIFICIAL LOVE. (vv.1-5)**

3:1 Therefore when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be
left behind at Athens alone, 2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's
fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as
to your faith,

3 so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for you

yourselves know that we have been destined for this.

4 For indeed when we
were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer
affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know.

5 For this reason, when I could
endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the
tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain.

Our text, Chapter 3, starts with the word “therefore”.
What is therefore?

It is stated in verse 17 of the previous chapter, Chapter 2. It reads,
“17 But we,
brethren, having been taken away from you for a short while — in person, not
in spirit — were all the more eager with great desire to see your face. 18 For we
wanted to come to you — I, Paul, more than once — and yet Satan hindered
us. 19 For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the
presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? 20 For you are our glory and joy.”

Paul, the great spiritual shepherd, deeply loves his spiritual flock. He deeply
loves his flock in Thessalonica. They are his glory. They are his joy. He desires
the spiritual best for them.

As a background, we read in the Bible—as in Acts 17—that Paul founded
the church in Thessalonica during his second missionary journey around the
year AD 51. The founding of the church was smooth but, immediately later,
the church was disturbed.

When the company of Paul reached Thessalonica, Paul went to the
synagogue and proclaimed the gospel. Many believed along with many God-
fearing Greek men and women.

Some Jews and God-fearing Greek men and women believed the gospel
shared by Paul and the Thessalonian church was founded.

Then the Jews were jealous. They took some evil men and formed a mob to
attack Paul and company in the house of Jason where Paul and company
were presumably staying. Paul and company were not there and the mob did
not find them. So, the mob dragged Jason for receiving Paul and company.
They branded Paul and his companions “men who upset the world” for
proclaiming Christ as King against Caesar who was then the earthly king of
Rome. The Jews dragged Jason, brought him to the authorities, and later
released after being pledged.

After Paul and company established the church, stayed there for a few days, and
had just started to teach them the gospel, they were forced to leave Thessalonica
to avoid physical harm from the persecuting mob. They proceeded to Bernea,
then to Athens, then to Corinth without any news of what happened to the church.
No means of long-distance communication were available then.

Paul loved the church greatly and was deeply concerned about the
persecution and what happened to the church.

**What was Paul most concerned with?**

a. Paul was concerned most about their faith.
v2: 2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel
of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,

Spreading the gospel—and having people receive it by faith in the power of
the Holy Spirit is very important for Paul. It is His mission to spread the gospel
by faith, particularly to the lost gentile sheep of Christ. Christ called Him
for this reason, which is to make the gospel known to the gentile world. He
already shared the gospel to them, and they already accepted the gospel by
faith. He cannot endure even the thought of them losing their faith in Christ.

They were surrounded with many tempters to challenge their faith in Christ.
Around them were the Judaizer Jews pressuring them to adopt the rituals
of the Old Testament. They were formerly idol worshipers and were still
surrounded by idolatry. They were taught and were still being encouraged to
embrace Greek philosophy.

Paul and his company experienced firsthand the strength of persecution in
Thessalonica.

Paul, the great spiritual shepherd, loved the Thessalonians. He was deeply
anxious of what happened to them particularly of their faith in Christ.
b. The true shepherd ascertains the security of his flock both physically
and spiritually.
v2: and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of
Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,

Indeed, the true shepherd ascertains the security of His flock.
i. We see these in Jesus, as He witnesses in all of scripture.
He is the good Shepherd, the perfect Shepherd.

Jesus knows His sheep given to Him by God the Father. He receives all
whom God gives Him and loses none of them. No one could be taken
away from Him.

He is a good shepherd for His sheep. He loves them with an agape,
sacrificial love—even while they were sinners and enemies of God, Christ
died for them.

Jesus laid down His life for His sheep so that they may have life
everlasting. His sheep may sin but the Holy Spirit who is in them convicts
them. So, they repent and God, who is faithful, forgives them.
His sheep knows His voice and He, likewise, knows the voice of His sheep.

Jesus is all sufficient for His sheep.

ii. We also see this in David.

David was a real shepherd to real sheep. He shepherded the flock of his
father. He took care of his real flock well and safely. He witnesses in 1
Samuel 17:34-36: when a bear and a lion attacked his flock, he fought
and killed both to protect them. When he became king of Israel—the
shepherd of Israel—he brought the kingdom to greatness.

iii. We see this in Paul.

Paul, like Jesus and David, gathered God’s sheep in all his life after being
called by the Lord as His instrument in proclaiming the gospel to the
gentiles, including God’s people in Thessalonica where he founded
the church. He shared the gospel, gathered, and shepherded God’s
people in every opportunity—whether he was defending his case
before authorities, in prison chains, or intentionally during his various
missionary journeys.

In our text, while Paul was in Athens, he wanted to see them but was
prevented to do so by Satan. In what way, it is not written. However,
he was determined to know by all means the condition of his flock in
Thessalonica. So, he sent Timothy—a young and faithful follower of
Christ, a good spiritual shepherd himself, a brother, and God's fellow
worker in the gospel of Christ—to Thessalonica to encourage them and
strengthen their faith, so they would become firm and able to resist
persecution and opposition.

Indeed, Paul was a good spiritual shepherd. He wanted his flock to be
strong in sustaining their faith—the faith in Christ which he planted in
them by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Likewise, all of us members and worshipers of BFHCF—not only the
servant leaders of the church, the Consistory members, the Pastors, the
heads and ministry cores, the pastoral staff, but all church members
and worshipers—must be faithful and spiritual shepherds, loving
our neighbors as ourselves. For indeed, the second most important
command of God is, “Love your neighbor as yourselves.”

Truly, as Paul being a good spiritual shepherd loving his flock, we too
must be good spiritual shepherds—loving our sheep assigned to us and
for one another.

**II. A TRUE SPIRITUAL SHEPHERD ENSURES THE WELL
BEING OF HIS FLOCK. (vv6-9)**

“6
But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news
of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us
just as we also long to see you,
7
for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and
affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;
8
for now we really live,

if you stand firm in the Lord.
9

For what thanks can we render to God for you in
return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account.”

As we learned earlier, Paul was anxious about the condition of the
Thessalonian church. He wanted to go to Thessalonica to find their condition
himself but was prevented by Satan. So, he sent Timothy instead.

In v6, Timothy had returned from Thessalonica to Paul in Corinth. He
brought very good news to Paul:

a. The faith and love of the Thessalonian church remained firm in the
Lord.

Despite the intense persecution and pressure of the part of the world they
were in, the Thessalonian church remained faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ.
They remained firm and strong in the Lord despite the absence of a trained
teacher to disciple them, nourish them of the word, and guide them in their
obedience to the word.

How true, indeed, that all those whom God gives to Christ by the Holy
Spirit—through His spiritual shepherds whom He called to be His
instruments, including you and me—our Lord does not lose. Truly, we the
spiritual shepherds. All of us believers are commanded to go and make
disciples everywhere, share the gospel to everyone but it is only God who
regenerates the dead spirits of unbelievers to enable them to hear the
gospel, believe it, receive it, and give them eternal lives.

That the Thessalonian Church remained faithful to the Lord despite being
persecuted and invaded with false teachings proves that they were truly in
Christ—children of God.

As the angels in heaven rejoice whenever an unbeliever believes, a spiritual
shepherd also rejoices when he or she finds a lost sheep and receives Christ.

A spiritual leader rejoices, as well, when he or she affirms that shepherds
remain faithful to the Lord despite the many and various trials, difficulties, and
enemies in the world. We rejoice when we see our sheep grow spiritually.

**III. A TRUE SPIRITUAL SHEPHERD PRAYS FOR HIS FLOCK.
(vv.10-13)**

3:10: as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your
face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?

11 Now may our God and Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you; 12
and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another,
and for all people, just as we also do for you; 13 so that He may establish your
hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of
our Lord Jesus with all His saints.

a. A spiritual shepherd prays for his flock.
3:10 as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your
face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?
As is the normal practice of Paul as he witnesses in all his letters in the
scripture, he also prayed for the Thessalonian church.

Paul, the good spiritual shepherd, prayed day and night for his flock. He
prayed incessantly as he instructs later in 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18, “pray
without ceasing, ... this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”

Prayer is very important for every child of God. It is the primary means of
cultivating and sustaining the relationship of a child of God to one’s heavenly
Father. Yes, people of God, by your prayers and mine and with consistent
reading of God’s word, we develop a more intimate relationship with God. We
hear more of His will for us. We become more submissive to His will.

Jesus Christ, while He was in the flesh on earth, prayed very often. He is truly
God and truly man, but He still prayed to the God, the Father.
Why did Christ pray to the Father?

Jesus Christ prayed to God because God is His Father. Being truly man, Christ
was dependent upon God, the Father. As Christ witnessed in John 5:19,
Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the
Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing;
for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
Christ, as man, depended upon the will of His Father God—our Father—in all
He did in the flesh on earth.

Likewise, all God’s people in scripture were prayerful and God blessed them.
In the same manner, Paul was prayerful. He, as a good spiritual shepherd,
prayed for His flock.

Paul rarely prayed for his own physical welfare except when he prayed that
his thorn in the flesh would be removed (2 Cor. 12:7-9). But the Lord told him
His grace is sufficient for him.

Paul prayed for the growth and firmness of faith of the Thessalonians.
Likewise, as spiritual shepherds, let us also pray incessantly. Let our every act
be an act of worship to God. In every act or every thought, let us always pray
for the presence of God the Father, in God the son—Christ Jesus—by the
counsel of the Holy Spirit guiding us to always do His will.

b. Paul prayed as well that their faith endures for the second coming of the Lord. (v13)
13 so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our
God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.

The Apostle prayed that the church would remain blameless and holy
because the Lord will be coming with all His saints.
Likewise, we all must remain steadfast in our faith in Christ as true spiritual
shepherds and lead our sheep or flock to be firm and strong in their faith
because our Lord is coming, and we must be blameless and holy in His name
to receive Him.

**SUMMARY:**

All of us Christians are spiritual or covenant shepherds.

A covenant and spiritual shepherd is modeled by the Apostle Paul in 1
Thessalonians 3.

1. A spiritual shepherd loves his flock with the agape sacrificial love.

2. A Spiritual shepherd strengthens the faith of his flock.

3. A spiritual shepherd prays for his flock.

**APPLICATION:**

People of God, we are all sheep of our great Shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ.
But He calls us His spiritual shepherds, as well, to care and nourish whom He
assigns us to shepherd. Let us be good spiritual shepherds as the Apostle Paul.

Let us love our flock with the agape sacrificial love. We must be willing
and ready to sacrifice our time, effort, and resources for their spiritual and
physical well-being. More importantly, we must strengthen their faith by
nourishing them with the Word of God and leading them to obey. We must
be prayerful, praying unceasingly, including interceding for their spiritual
strengthening. In our prayers we must continue remembering the second
coming of the Lord to bring us to heaven so that we can persevere in our
faith and obey what God wills for us to do.

To God be the glory in everything.
