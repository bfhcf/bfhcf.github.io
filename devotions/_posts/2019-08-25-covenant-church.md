title: Covenant Church - God's People, God's House

The events in the text took place after some time when David has been
anointed as king of Israel. This was after some time when he had defeated
the Philistines and he had removed the Jebusites from their domain. This
was also the time when the Ark of the Covenant was brought by the David
and his people to the city of David which we now know as Jerusalem.

*2 SAMUEL 7:1-17 (ESV) 1
Now when the king lived in his house and the Lord had given him rest from all his
surrounding enemies, 2
the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house
of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.” 3 And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you.”4
But that same night the word of the Lord came
to Nathan, 5
“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: Would you build me a
house to dwell in? 6
I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people
of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling.
7 In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with
any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying,
“Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’ 8 Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my
servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following
the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. 9 And I have been with you
wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make
for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. 10 And I will appoint a
place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place
and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, 11 from
the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all
your enemies. Moreover, the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house.
12 When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your
offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom 13 He
shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
14 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will
discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, 15 but my steadfast
love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. 16
And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne
shall be established forever.’” 17 In accordance with all these words, and in accordance
with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.*

From the time of Moses and even to the
time of David, there was this particular
enclosure (left). And this is the enclosure of
the tabernacle of God—in other words, the
Tent of God. The tent is bounded by linen
which are attached to pegs. At the front of
the tent is a gate which leads to the Altar
of Burnt Offering where animal sacrifices
are conducted. The Laver is a basin where
the blood of the animal is prepared. Then,
when the blood is prepared, it is brought immediately into the first chamber of
the tent. Beyond the first chamber of the tent is the Holy of Holies—it is where
the Ark of the Covenant is housed. For all intents and purposes, the Ark of the
Covenant—which is the symbol of the Holy law of God—is housed in a tent.

Here is an artist’s graphic
representation of David’s house
(right), which was actually a palace
and was almost like a fortress.
Remember that David, as a king, was
a military tactician and he has situated
his house high on a hill so that he can
see his enemies from a distance. This
is a magnificent house and this artist’s
rendition is based on actual, present
day archeological data.


As you can see, the two are very different. The house of David was grand
and majestic but the tent sheltering the Ark of the Covenant was very simple.
Because of this, David had a problem. He was struggling in his spirit—he
had an issue. This was David’s inner struggle: **God’s house should be more
majestic than my house.**

It deeply bothered him that his house was made of cedar, but the house
of the Ark of the Covenant was made of linen. It’s made of a few pieces of
wood and posts, but it is made mostly of linen—and it’s a tent. So, he came
to this conclusion: God needs a house. Because of what he was struggling
with, David came to the conclusion that, “I should not be dwelling here. **God
needs a more grandiose or majestic house. Therefore, God needs a house.”**

To him, the Ark of the Covenant—which is merely a symbol of the law of
God—is actually God’s dwelling so it deserves a better house.
What actually happened? To summarize the lesson from the text, God’s
answer to David through the prophet Nathan was this: “David, thank you,
but, no thanks. I do not need a house.”

This is the lesson that David learned: God’s revealed will must guide our
intentions. This is also the lesson that all of us should learn. Our intentions cannot
dictate the will of God by citing snippets of passages that allude to His revealed
will. God’s revealed will must guide our intentions and not the other way around.
We must also realize that the phrase “God’s house” or “house of God” may be
incorrectly used because it maybe incorrectly understood. The danger to that is
that incorrect understanding leads to incorrect actions. Our understanding of
something governs the way we decide and the way we decide governs the way
we act. Therefore, it all starts with a correct understanding, which would lead to
a correct decision, which would lead to correct actions or responses.

The issue of the incorrect use of the phrase “house of God” leads us to our
main truth:

**The house of God has nothing to do with a physical structure,
but it has everything to do with His covenant people.**

It begs the question: What are the truths that will give us a correct
understanding of the phrase “God’s house?”

**I. GOD’S HOUSE IS WHEREVER HIS COVENANT PEOPLE ARE**

*Verse 7: “In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I
speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd
my people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’*

Let’s answer the question. Was there any instance, prior to this text, where
God asked the prophets who lived before David, “Why did you not build me
a house of cedar?” Was there ever?
In your readings of scripture, was there ever any moment in time that God
asked His prophets why they did not build Him a house made of this very
precious wood? Was there ever?  

The answer is none.

There was never any time in the past, prior to this, when God reckoned with His
people and His prophets as to why they did not build Him a house of cedar.

*Verse 8: Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says
the Lord of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that
you should be prince over my people Israel.
9 And I have been with you
wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I
will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.”*

This is the inner chamber of the
tabernacle of Moses (left). It is
divided by a partition of blue
linen cloth—according to the
specifications of what God’s will
was. This separates the anteroom—
where the menorah is—from the Ark
of the Covenant. It is a portable case
which housed the tablets where the
law of God was written.

Also significant are the two cherubs and the
top covering (right) where they are placed on
which is called the mercy seat. It is believed
by the Jews that the throne of God is actually
there. It is called the mercy seat because
every atonement celebration, every year, the
chief priest among the Jews goes by himself
to the Holy of Holies and atones for his sin, the
sins of his family, and the sins of all Israel.

Before he goes there, he slaughters an animal, he prepares the blood, he
goes and prays into the antechamber, and goes into the inner chamber
and puts drops of blood onto the top covering between the two cherubs.
They believe that is how they atone for their sins, the sins of their family, and
the sins of all Israel. So, they were anxious if God will actually accept their
sacrifice of atonement. Unless they’re able to walk out of this alive, they’re
really scared about what’s going to happen.

Having said that, the Ark of the Covenant was being carried by the ancient
Israelites wherever they went—when they went to battle, when they encamp,
when they rested. David has positioned the Ark of the Covenant in the city of
David, which is now Jerusalem, and in the same manner by which they were
instructed to during the time of Moses.

What is God saying to David?

Is the Ark of the Covenant able to confine me? That is what God is actually asking
David. Is the Ark of the Covenant sufficient enough to contain me as God?

**God is not and cannot be confined by anything made with human hands.
He chooses to dwell in and among His people.**

God cannot be contained by the Ark. He cannot be contained by the tent.
Otherwise, if he were contained in the ark or within the tent, He will not be
able to kill the enemies of David. So, for all intents and purposes—and as
logic would dictate—it is impossible for the ark or the tent to contain God.

This is what God is saying to David: I choose to dwell in you and among
you—among the people of Israel.

**God’s covenant people make up the whole house of God because God is
present in and among them.**

Do you consider yourselves part of God’s covenant people? The answer is
yes. And, for all intents and purposes, do you remember what it means to be
God’s covenant people?

God’s covenant people are the recipients of God’s promises which is this: I will be God to you and to your elect descendants after you for an everlasting covenant. Because you are joined to the seed of the covenant who is Jesus Christ. That is the covenant. And if you are joined to Jesus Christ, you are part of God’s covenant people.

**You and I make up the house of God.**

This is the true definition of the house of God. You and I—we are the house
of God. If you are a covenant person and you believe without a shadow of
a doubt that God has called you from eternity past, justified you because of
the atoning work of Jesus Christ, then you are part of the house of God. And
all of us make up the house of God. Even Christians who are not here. Even
covenant people of God who are not here. All of us make up the house of God.

Here now is the question: In the context of us building a new sanctuary for
Bread From Heaven as a new place of worship, is it correct to say that God
needs a new house? By your understanding and by the definition of what the
house of God is, does God need a “new house?”

Of course not.

**God’s covenant people have been marked from eternity past, will be
preserved in eternity present, and will be glorified in eternity future.**

If we say that God needs a new house, there is a philosophical problem with
that. Because if God needs a new house and if the covenant people of God
make up the house of God, then He has to replace His covenant people. And
if He replaces His covenant people, He has changed his mind. And if He has
changed His mind, there is something wrong with the way He thinks because
He’s not sure of what He’s doing. And if He’s not sure of what He’s doing, there
is reason to question His omniscience, His all-knowingness. And if there is
reason to question His omniscience, there is reason to question His being God.

Does God need a new house? By the definition provided for us by the text,
He does not. God’s covenant people make up the house of God. In other
words, you and I make up the house of God.

How do the people who make up God’s house give glory to Him?

**By being His image bearers in the present time.**

What does that mean? Remember that in the garden, He commissioned one
aspect of creation to be His image bearers. Did He commission the fish to
be image bearers? No. Did He commission the plants to be image bearers?
No. Did He commission the very beautiful garden that they were in to be an
image bearer? 

The answer is no.

He commissioned only one aspect of creation—that which He created last—
to be the image bearers of His glory. Who is that? Adam, who is man.
So, by virtue of this definition, we as people of God have the mandate to
become His image bearers and this is how we give glory to Him—to be
image bearers in the time that we live.

**There is no man-made structure that can give glory to God.**

There can be no building that can give glory to God. There can be no
process flow that can give glory to God.

How does God’s house give glory to Him?
- Do our lives reflect His holiness?
We are image bearers, right? We should be able to reflect His holiness.
As God said, “Be holy for I am holy.” Do our lives reflect His holiness? The
answer is that we should.
- Do we make an impact in our community by evangelizing,
evangelizing faithfully, and evangelizing correctly?
As God’s people who make up His house, we should.
- Do His ministers strike the balance between truth and grace when
handling His word? We should. We most definitely should.
- Do we show mercy and compassion to God’s covenant people?
Do we show mercy, kindness, and charity to each other? The answer is
that we should

Yes, we should aspire for holiness. Yes, we should make an impact in our
community by evangelizing, evangelizing faithfully, and evangelizing correctly.
Yes, we should strike the balance between truth and grace and handling with
care the word of God—handling with precision what is said whether from the
pulpit our outside the pulpit when it comes to the word of God. And, yes, we
most definitely should show mercy and compassion to each other.
These are the reality check questions which would guide us—God’s people
who make up His house—on how to glorify Him.

They say that a picture paints a thousand words. Let’s look at a few.

<img src="{{ site.devotion_images_url }}/covenant_church/covenant_church_3.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5 mb-5"/>

This picture of a magnificent spire—for those
of you who haven’t been here—was taken on a
beautiful day on the grounds of what is called The
Cathedral of St. Pierre or Cathédrale Saint-Pierre.
It is the church where John Calvin preached in
Geneva, Switzerland.

When you go inside, you
will see this. 

<img src="{{ site.devotion_images_url }}/covenant_church/covenant_church_4.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5 mb-5"/>

Yours truly is standing beside
the staircase which John
Calvin actually used
when he preached his
messages. However, at
the back of that housed the archives of everything
that was used to teach the people of Geneva. So,
I went there and I looked for the Bible that John
Calvin used and I asked if there are any other Bible
that are in print—the Geneva Bible should be in print
there, the preachings of Calvin should be there.

Apparently, they’re not there. You know what is housed in the library? A small
pamphlet on Islam for Beginners and Post-Modernism for Dummies. There is no
record of anything, there is no written record that there was once a church that God
used to bring light to the nations. Nothing. Based on this picture, there is no worship
service that takes place here. If there is ever a worship service that would take place
there, it would be a Pastor brought from the outside so that the tourists who come
would be able to listen to a worship service. But there was nothing there.

The question is this: Despite the beautiful structure, despite the beautiful
staircase, despite the beautiful and grand interior, do you think God made His
dwelling there?

Of course not.

But I would like to show you something else.

<img src="{{ site.devotion_images_url }}/covenant_church/covenant_church_6.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5 mb-5"/>

Here is a rundown building and there’s
construction at the front—probably the
sewage system. This is a rundown building
which used to be a computer store 40 minutes
north of Milan, Italy. What do you see? Based
on how it looks, is it something you would
want to go to? It looks like a scary place in an
industrial part of Italy.

But look at what’s inside.

<img src="{{ site.devotion_images_url }}/covenant_church/covenant_church_5.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5 mb-5"/>

What’s inside is a church of 25 to 30 people studying intently, verse by verse, and
doing an exposition of scripture. When we
went there, they were actually studying
Colossians chapter 2. And I heard—although
I understand a little Italian—they were doing
an exposition of Colossians 2, when the
Pastor said, “God transferred us from the
kingdom of darkness to the Kingdom of His
Son.” That’s the Senior Pastor, Pastor Andrea
Ferrari to my right and to my left, his Associate
Pastor, Rev. Mark Patterson.

In this particular setting, we have a people who are actually edifying each other,
giving counsel to each other, teaching each other, iron sharpening another
piece of iron because they were committed to the study of the word of God.

My question is this: Is this place alive? Is this rundown computer store
housing the people of God? YES!

**Therefore, structure has nothing to do with the house of God.**

Now, you might be asking, “Why the timing of this particular message? Why
now? Why with these [plans for a new building]?”

**Brothers and sisters, what we are saying here is that it is incorrect and
imprecise to say that God needs a house because He does not need a
house. His glory is sufficient in and of himself. He cannot be housed by
any structure made by human hands.**

But it also begs the question:

“Does Bread From Heaven Christian Fellowship, a church of God’s
covenant people, need a sanctuary for worship?”
The answer is most definitely YES.

What we are trying to correct here, brothers and sisters, is a mindset and a
set of Theology which needs to be corrected. The house of God is made up
of you and I—we are the house of God. You are covenant people, then you
make up the house of God. We are covenant people, then we make up the
house of God. That’s what we are trying to say.

The first truth that will help us correctly understand the phrase “God’s house” is:
God’s house is wherever his covenant people are.

Is it right to say God needs a house?

**NO.**

Is it right to say that Bread From Heaven Christian
Fellowship—a group of believers who are covenant people
of God—need a sanctuary or a building so that they can have
ministry and conduct their worship service in?

**YES.**

This is what we’re trying to correct.

**II. GOD’S HOUSE WAS MADE BY HIM AS A FUTURE
DWELLING PLACE FOR HIS COVENANT PEOPLE**

_Verses 10 and 11: “And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant
them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And
violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed
judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies.
Moreover, the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house.”_

Earlier, when we read our first reference text, what did God say? “And I have
been with you.” Present perfect tense. He was with them in the past, He was
there with them at that time, and He is here with us now.

Now, let me say this about the house of God.

**The house of God is both already here and not yet here.**

There is something about the house of God that is already here but, then again, there
is also something about the house of God that is not yet here. And what is that?

The house of God is here because God has made, and still makes His
dwelling in and among His people. There are people who are being added
to those ordained to salvation every day—every day someone responds to
the call. So, therefore, the church of God is already here because God has
made and still makes His dwelling in and among His people. And yet, it is
not here because the complete triumph of God over His enemies has not
happened yet.

Has it happened already? Not yet. Why?

Because we, as God’s people still experience persecution and we are still
exposed to deceit from false teachers. There are many who are actually
twisting the Word of God today. There are many who are trying to come up
with Theological positions—which are false—and they try to use Scripture
to justify their false Theological positions. In other words, there are false
teachers. However, we still experience persecution today.

<img src="{{ site.devotion_images_url }}/covenant_church/covenant_church_7.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5 mb-5"/>

This is a picture taken about
three weeks ago in the garden of South
Yarra Presbyterian Church in a part
of Melbourne, Australia that is very
difficult to access. To the right of Dr.
Malou is the Senior Pastor, Rev. John
Stasse—a gifted and Godly man, and
a good preacher. To his right is Elder
Jack Adlawan and his wife from Cebu.

During our very pleasant visit there, I asked the Senior Pastor, “Pastor John, if
there was anything that you would want for us to pray for you, what would it be?”
He said, “First, could you pray that our fellowship would be more robust and that
some of the people who live from one part of Melbourne, very far, and the other
ones who live on the opposite end would not have any difficulty travelling to the
place of worship (because it was located in a rather hidden part of the Punt Road)
so that they can come and fellowship on a more regular basis?”

I said, “All right. What else would you want us to pray for?”

This is what he said, “Please pray for this: There is a bill which will probably
be in the Australian legislative bodies within the next two weeks. And the bill
is supposed to tackle what is known as The Freedom of Religion Act of the
state of Victoria in Australia.”

The term freedom of religion, according to him, should not actually be a bill
talking about freedom of religion but instead it should be a bill talking about
freedom from religion. They wanted us to pray that this bill does not prosper
because if it does and becomes law in the state of Victoria, all the things that he
will be able to say from the pulpit, he will be able to say. No problem. He can talk
about sin as sin, he can talk about heresy as heresy, and he can talk about sexual
perversion as sin with no issues. But, since he’s also a writer and has a website
where they write the transcripts of their messages and air by podcast their
sermons, anything that can be heard there in public space and be interpreted as
an offense by those who are hearing it can get them into serious trouble. They
may lose their tax-exempt status as a church, they may be receiving lawsuits
left and right for fomenting hate and discrimination, hate speech, and they can
actually be indicted for issues like that. He was saying, “please pray.”

This has happened in other parts of the world. And my brothers and sisters,
this is what I will say to you, not as a prophetic pronouncement but just
as something that I, perhaps, see happening to us: In about 7 to 10 years,
I foresee, that legislation banning hate speech against certain groups—
actually, truth statements about sin of the practice of homosexuality—will be
enacted into law in the country.

The same is true with Canada. They have fallen in as far as the law is
concerned. America has fallen as far as the law is concerned. Australia is
about to fall as far as the law is concerned. Very close to us, Taiwan, has
fallen as far as the law is concerned. But what did Jesus say? **“The gates of
hell will not prevail over my church.”** That’s what Jesus Christ said.

So, what do we do as God’s people?

As early as now, your leadership, your Pastors, were convicted to write a Statement
of Faith. A Statement of Faith which will embody our core beliefs as Christians,
honoring the sovereignty of God above all things, calling out man for his depravity
and sin, and calling on the grace of God through Jesus Christ as the only solution
for the impending wrath of God. That is what we intend to write and hopefully we
can also use that as a tool in order for us to evangelize our immediate community.

**The full realization of God’s house is when all of God’s people stand in
worship of God free of any pain and suffering.**

This is something that is still to happen in the future.
The second truth that will teach us to correctly understand the phrase “God’s house” is:
God’s house was made by Him as a future dwelling place for His
covenant people.

**III. GOD’S HOUSE IS FOREVER RULED BY THE KING WHO
PAID FOR THE SINS OF ALL OF GOD’S PEOPLE**

_Verses 12 to 15: “When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your
fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body,
and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will
establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and he
shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the
rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, but my steadfast love will not
depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you”_

Who do you think is the person God is alluding to in this passage?

On initial reading, He’s alluding to King Solomon, the son of David. Because
it is true that God loved Solomon. Did Solomon commit iniquity? Yes, all
7,000 of them plus a few other things here and there. When he committed
iniquity, did God discipline him with the rod of men? Yes. And for all intents
and purposes, Solomon lost the kingdom of his lineage. After he had passed,
his kingdom was torn down, civil war broke out, and Israel was divided into
two kingdoms: the Northern and the Southern Kingdom. Therefore, you have
a kingdom which was lost.

But look at the promise of God in the passage: _“When your days are fulfilled and
you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall
come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house
for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.”_ But the
kingdom was destroyed! Was God wrong? The kingdom was shattered into two,
but God is saying that the throne of his kingdom is going to be forever.

Brothers and sisters, when you see something like this, we call it a
Covenantal Statement. It is similar to Genesis 17:7 where God says, “I will be
God to you and to your descendants after you for an everlasting covenant.”
It’s the same as, _“When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your
fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you...”_

But, as I was saying, Solomon failed. He was a failure. He actually committed
iniquity. But, you know something? The kingdom of God was actually held. The
kingdom of God was actually preserved. But it was not Solomon who ruled the
kingdom. Because after this had happed, after the kingdom of Solomon was lost,
Israel descended into chaos. And, at one time, they were being ruled by kings
who were idolaters, pagan worshippers, murderers, and revilers—and it came to
a point, 300 years after this was written, there was a king who had a wife named
Jezebel, his name is King Ahab. During his time, there lived another prophet who
wrote in the 53rd chapter of his writing, _“He was crushed for our iniquities, the
chastisement which was deserving of us that brought us peace fell upon him, and
with his stripes we are healed.”_ He was referring to somebody else. God, here,
was referring to someone else in the future.

This is a Covenant Statement. When you talk about a covenant statement,
its current understanding is based on a present reality but it’s actually a
foreshadowing of something. It is a foreshadowing of one who did not
commit iniquity, but he bore for us the discipline and he bore for us the
stripes. Who was that person? One who did not commit iniquity but, yet, he
held the kingdom because he was anointed as King.

Who is that person? Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

**The rule of Jesus Christ as King over the house of God was established
after He resurrected from the dead.**

**The house of God which is made up of His people chosen before
the beginning of time which is now ruled by Christ is known as the ‘universal’ or catholic church.**

Note that there is no _Roman_ there. Catholic means all-encompassing or universal.

I would like to share with you a passage from one of our more beloved
writings during the Reformed Era:

**The Lord’s Day 21, Heidelberg Catechism**

**Question: What do you believe concerning the ‘holy catholic Christian church?’**

**Answer: I believe that the Son of God, out of the whole human race, from
the beginning of the world to its end, gathers, defends, and preserves
for himself, by his Spirit and Word, in the unity of the true faith, a church
chosen to everlasting life**

**And I believe that I am and forever shall remain a living member of it**

Brothers and sisters, let us summarize what we have learned.

The house of God has nothing to do with a physical structure but has
everything to do with His covenant people. What are the truths that will
give us a correct understanding of the phrase “God’s house?”
* God’s house is wherever His people are
* God’s house was made by Him as a future dwelling place
for His covenant people
* God’s house is forever ruled by the King who paid for the
sins of all of God’s people
