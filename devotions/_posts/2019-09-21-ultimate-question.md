title: The Ultimate Question
author: Dino Poblete
---
Before we understand that Jesus is the Ultimate answer, we need to understand first the answer to this question. What is it? 
Life is full of questions. Some are trivial, some more serious — and some tremendously important. 

It may be about:
* Your health – Why do I have this sickness? Why am I not getting healed? Why am I getting sick? 
* Your financial situation – How can I save? How do I pay my bills? Where do I invest?
* Your job – Did I choose the right career? What do I want to achieve in life? Am I able to support my family through my job? Will this job take me to greater heights? 
* Your family – Why is my family not as united as the other family? Why is my dad like this? Why is my mom like this? Why is there no peace in the house? Why is there chaos in the house? 
* Your studies – Why am I studying? Why is it hard to study? Why am I failing? Why do I need to have high grades? 
* Your future – Where will my life take me? Where will I go? Is there more to life than this? 

Most of these problems can be answered. Some we can’t. But for us to answer these questions we need to ask ourselves first. 

**WHO AM I?** 

Before we understand that Jesus is the Ultimate answer, we need to understand first the answer to this question. Who Am I?
What do we want? Good health, financial stability, secure employment, a contented family and a good future. The things that we do now defines who we are. And the reason you’re doing these things is because you think these things describes who you are. You may want to prove something! Probably your status. Or your beliefs.

This is where our self-image kicks in.

Often, we feel the pressure to define ourselves through our jobs, financial status, successes, grades, appearance, what other people say about us and many other means.
But Let’s go back to that Question. Who Am I? 

When problems and troubles come, how will we handle it? 

What happens to our identity when we experience failure? Or lose someone’s favor? Or become tired in our jobs or place of service? 
The very foundation of our identity is shaken and altered, we start to define ourselves by something or someone else. 
It’s difficult and impossible to define our stability and security in things that are of the world. We define it as external things. That is the paradox of life. Change is the opposite of Stability. When circumstances change, our self-image/identity constantly changes too. We will never feel satisfied or stable. We don’t know who we are anymore or what defines us. Then we end up having what we call an Identity Crisis

**What Is an Identity Crisis?**

If we feel unsure of our role in life or we feel like we don't know the 'real us' , then we may be experiencing an identity crisis. I experienced this myself during my teenage years. (There was one point in my life I felt worthless, I felt I was never good enough, I felt I deserve this or that, but I didn’t.) 
Theorist Erikson coined the term identity crisis and believed that it was one of the most important conflicts people face in development. At some point in our life we would experience this.

According to Erikson, an identity crisis is a time of intensive analysis and exploration of different ways of looking at oneself. 

In Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, the identity crisis normally occurs during the teenage years in which people struggle with feelings of identity versus role confusion.

Identity crises are more common today than in Erikson's day. These conflicts are certainly not confined to the teenage years.
People often experience them at different points in life, especially at points where there is a great change, including:

* Losing or starting a job
* Beginning a new relationship
* Ending a marriage or partnership
* Having a child
* Losing a loved one
* Moving
* Experiencing a traumatic event
* Learning about a health condition

Identity crises are also common among people with mental illness, including depressions, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder.

It’s just a matter of how we handle this situation. But speaking of Identity. Why are we defining our identity? 

As Christians, do we even define our identity? 

**How should we define our identity?** 

Let’s take this passage for example. This is a story of a military leader, a well known judge and prophet. Who defined his identity by his past. By his situation. How did God change that? Let’s hear it. The story of Gideon.

**Judges 6: 1-16**  
_Midian Oppresses Israel
6 1 The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian seven years. 2 And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. 3 For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. 
4 They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey. 5 For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number—both they and their camels could not be counted—so that they laid waste the land as they came in. 6 And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord.
7 When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on account of the Midianites, 8 the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery. 9 And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. 10 And I said to you, ‘I am the Lord your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.’ But you have not obeyed my voice.”
The Call of Gideon
11 Now the angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. 12 And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, “The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor.” 13 And Gideon said to him, “Please, my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.” 
14 And the Lord[a] turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?” 15 And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.” 16 And the Lord said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”
now, if you're familiar with Judges you'll know that, guess what, it's about the judges. It's about these deliverers who God raised up, and there is a cycle in the book - I don't have time to through the whole book - but there is a cycle whereby God's people start to depart from Him, and then the Lord allows them to be overwhelmed and overcome by an enemy. Then, when they finally wise up and realize that it's their own sins that have brought this judgement against them, they repent and God then raises up a 'judge', or a savior, leader is a basic way of looking at each judge._

As we can see Gideon had an identity crisis here. 

Gideon’s identity became insecure due to this current situation and role in his clan. He thinks he’s the weakest of them all.
How did God address his identity crisis? 

We can learn certain truths about how the Lord deals with our identity crisis.

Let’s go to our first point.

#### **I. THE LORD REMINDS US THAT WE ARE NEVER DESIGNED BY MISTAKE; WE ARE FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE**

_12 “The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor.”_

Gideon felt the weakest in his father’s house. He felt not suitable for what the Lord has commanded him to do. He felt that the Lord might be choosing the wrong person. He was a doubter. He doubted his own abilities. 
But how did God describe him? He was described as a mighty man of valor.
His self-image was more important than his true identity.

So wait, what is self-image and identity? Are they one and the same?

Picture of man and the mirror (Actual man Is identity, mirror image is your self-image) 

So as you can see one is reality and fact, and the other is perception

**Self-Image** is how we perceive ourselves and how it affects our well-being.  
**Identity** is who we truly are.

And the danger of looking too much into our Self Image is that the way we see ourselves mainly affects how we view God. 

We sometimes bombard ourselves with negative self-talk: that you're ugly, or stupid, worthless a failure, a loser, or useless. A lot of us may be reciting these things. They might be things that were said over us by another person, but we’ve begin to accept it. This is where the enemy attacks and try to oppress our minds. 

Is that what you think how God made you? Is that how you think God sees you?
What is the truth? Well, the truth is, if you're a Christian, you have a new identity. And your new identity is a result of what Jesus has done for you and in your life. 
Remember that through His sacrifice at the Cross, His blood was shed in order to redeem us and free us from slavery of sin. With every drop of blood, He cleanses us of all our sin. And He has given us a new identity. An Identity that can never change and nothing on earth can ever change.

The problem is: 
Some of us are not living out of our new identity, we remain in the past on how we have always seen ourselves. “I’ve always been like this”…. Yes you may have trusted Christ as your own and personal Saviour, but you’re not living in the reality of  what the scripture says about our identity. In 2 Corinthians 5:17, it says: 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation; old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new'.

**Where do you think your true identity lies? Where?**
* Does it lie with yourself? 
* Does it lie with your own self-image 
* Does it lie with your perception of who you are? 
* Does it lie with your family or your friends? 
* Does it lie when we are accepted in this world? 
* Does it lie with public opinion, what society says or thinks? 
* Does it lie with popular culture? 

NO! We are Christians who believe the Word of God, and we believe God Almighty is the only One who made us, who formed us, who designed us, and He created us in His own image, and He has authored our destiny. He is the author and perfecter of our faith. We don’t state who we are. We don’t have the right mind to define who we are. He is the only one who has transformed us and has the right to tell us what our identity is. Not the world. Not our friends. Not our society nor even our family! It is God who designed us! 
We are never a failure! 

Kurt Cobain - anybody know who Kurt Cobain was? He was the lead singer of 'Nirvana', and we believe he killed himself - shot himself with a revolver. Yet he made this very profound statement: 'Pretending to be someone you're not is a waste of the person you are'. he certainly hadn't found satisfaction or peace when he took his own life. 
We are all Christians and it’s never a waste of a person we are if we are identified in Christ. It is never a waste if we want to be like Jesus.

We need to stop wearing our mask. I believe all of us here are wearing some kind of mask. 
What is the image that we put on in the morning, in office, in our families, or in school? Is it the true identity, your true self?

Maybe we have a different face that you put on for different situations, depending on the people that you meet in any given day?

We have to show the world our true identity, the identity we have in Christ. Your self-image doesn’t matter. You are more valuable than what you think you are now. We are all precious in God’s eyes. All of us are fearfully and wonderfully made. 

Gideon thinks he is weak, but the Lord said otherwise. He is a mighty man of valor! Let’s not define who we are based on our weaknesses. Remember what the bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:9, 9 And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast [a]about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. 10 Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with [b]insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.

Now let’s ask ourselves again, WHO AM I?  By now it should be clear for all of us, who we are. As Christians, we can’t define ourselves by how the world sees us. The world is corrupted as it is now. We can’t anymore pattern ourselves our identity or try to adapt ourselves to today’s world. We need to be different. It’s okay to be different….. For Jesus. 

Some of you may have encountered this before, but if you've got a problem with your identity and you're struggling with self-image, then hold on to this simple truth – 

**YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD.** 

You are accepted. You belong to Him. And We are confident that the good work God has begun in us will be perfected. 
And when a bad situation or a bad problem arises ask yourself first this question before asking the others. Who Am I? I am a child of God. Therefore whatever it is that life throws on me, I will never be shaken because I know the Lord is with me. The Lord knows what’s best for me. 

If you’ve just experienced a terrible break up in your relationship and you are scarred by it and you feel that you’re worthless or incomplete, remember this: Your worth is not defined by your partner, your worth is far more precious than that, You are a child of God. God has someone better stored for you!

If you have a problem with your family, ask yourself, Who Am I? I am a child of God and if I’m a child of God I know God is with me and will make things right for my family.  
So our identity shapes who we are, and the way we see ourselves affect how we see God. 

#### **II. THE LORD REMINDS US THAT WE ARE NEVER DEFINED BY OUR PAST; OUR TRUE IDENTITY COMES FROM HOW HE SEES US**

_15 And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house_

We all have a story.

No matter where you are on the journey, there is a plan and a purpose to what you experience.
Gideon thinks his past or what he is now defines who he is. But the Lord has other plans for him. He made him one of the greatest military leaders and judges for Israel.

You’ve seen similar stories, of people who had this kind of life.

Many people nowadays suffer from depression. (Analytics) And due to depression people are led to start thinking about suicide. And the source of depression are many things, like family, friends, career. This is because of poorly constructed self-image. Because of a bad past.

A bad past should not stop us from pursuing life. Even if we are Christians, we can still experience this. But The Lord turns our past into purpose. There is more to life than our past. 

We sometimes tend to believe what the enemy says about us, rather than what God says about us in His intended creation and in His redemption of us through Jesus on the cross. We should not dwell in the past forever. Our identity is not defined by our past experiences. Those are just lies of the enemy.

We need to see ourselves the way God says we are! We need to stop identifying ourselves by how people see us, or by our past, and see who we are in the eyes of God. You are valuable in His sight.

Gideon felt that his clan will never be able to survive because it’s the weakest. But the Lord sees otherwise. He had a better plan for him and his family. 
The same way, God sees our past as merely steps for us to be what He wants us to be. All for His glory. 

It’s not a matter of who you are, where you're from, what your family  is like, or how different and weak you might feel: The Lord says: 'I am with you'. 'I am with you to guide you and protect you’. ‘I will turn your past into purpose’. ‘There is a purpose why I created you’. And I have a better plan for you and you will never be defeated.’

Which points us to our third lesson:

#### **III. THE LORD REMINDS US THAT WE ARE NEVER DEFEATED; BUT OUR VICTORIES ARE NOT OUR OWN DOING**

_14 “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?”
16 And the Lord said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man._

If you read until chapter 8 of Judges, Si Gideon was full of himself. He felt his victories are because of what He did. He even said 

In verse 23, Gideon gave his answer. “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you.”

But no, after that He still acted like a King, getting all the glory he wants by killing kings and getting jewelries all for himself. Most interestingly, he named his son Abimelech (8:31) which means “my father is king.” He has been full of himself.

When God changes our identity, and when God blesses, our identity can become corrupted by sinful thoughts because of Pride. We want more. And we forget the reason why we are now who we are now. 

Our self-image comes into picture again. Either because of a bad past or a good past, both can be used against us. 

The only way to battle that is to be grateful and remember our true identity: How God sees us. Our victories and success in life are not because of our strength, it’s because God gave us that strength. Gideon forgot about that and he fell short just like any of us. 

The Lord is with us yes, we are never defeated. But Let’s remember the reason for our victories. Let’s remember the source of our blessings. 

The Lord has lifted us up, let’s never take that for granted.

Dr. Dale Ralph Davis (A reformed preacher) points out that this is the struggle of every Christian. We all struggle to make our practice as good as our theology. He states “It is ever our danger that after being used of God in some way, we mouth humility but practice pride. We may know occasions of the Spirit’s power and yet lack the Spirit’s wisdom.”

We pray to the Lord faithfully and depend on Him alone when trial comes, but when we have been rescued and blessed, we forget to thank Him, we forget that all the increase came from Him.

Let not our self-image be our focus, but see our identity as how Christ sees us. 

Let’s be thankful for everything. God is a forgiving God.

That In spite of all of Gideon’s foolishness, in spite of all of our doubts and fears and failings, God still won. He is still the hero, and He still loves us. AMEN!

**So what can we learn about our Identity? We ask ourselves Who Am I? Here are the lessons:**

* **THE LORD REMINDS US THAT WE ARE NEVER DESIGNED BY MISTAKE; WE ARE FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE**   
Who we think we are not is not how we were created, God created us wonderfully. We are very valuable. Worth the blood of Jesus Christ. 

* **THE LORD REMINDS US THAT WE ARE NEVER DEFINED BY OUR PAST; OUR TRUE IDENTITY COMES FROM HOW HE SEES US**  
The Lord transforms us. And that transformation turns our past into purpose.

* **THE LORD REMINDS US THAT WE ARE NEVER DEFEATED; OUR VICTORIES ARE NOT OUR OWN DOING**  
Let’s never forget that our victories is not because of us, but because of God we gave us strength each and every day.
