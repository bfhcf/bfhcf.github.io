   Lord?

These questions we can classify into 3 issues that the Young People are facing:
1. Life Issues
2. Doctrinal Issues
3. Identity/Relational Issues

These kinds of issues are important to the life of a young person. Questions
like these are what a young person wrestles with, and these are questions
that form the mindsets and worldviews of young people. These questions
also provide a glimpse into the heart and mind of young people. Where can
we go to find the answers to these questions.

These kinds of questions can be answered depending on the foundation,
or lack of, of the person asking: I want to do something? YOLO, bro! Go for it,
follow your heart. My family doesn’t like or appreciate me? I’ll turn to drugs,
or friends, I can find my satisfaction there. What would happen is that he or
she would end up with a broken life.

That is why it is important to look for the one and only answer to the
questions of life, who is Jesus Christ alone. These kinds of questions are the
reason why the theme for this month is: Jesus, The Ultimate Answer. Our
passage is taken from Matthew 28, where Christ gave His commission to the
disciples before His ascension.

The Great Commission (NIV) 
*16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus
had told them to go. 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some
doubted. 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on
earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I
am with you always, to the very end of the age.”*

So, who is Jesus to you? Is He really the ultimate answer to your questions in life?
Please note that this happened when Jesus was about to ascend to heaven.
This happened after His death and resurrection. When He died, He died for
the sins of you and I. When He resurrected, He announced His victory over
death. He broke our bonds of guilt and shame.

I will say this right away: if Christ is not the Lord and Savior of your life, it will
be easy, yet extremely painful, to find your answers to life somewhere else.
Anything else that you consider your answer apart from Christ is wrong. It is
sin. When Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, He defeated the works
of the enemy. He became the ultimate answer to life’s questions.

You have questions about your identity? Your beliefs? Your family, relationships?
Why turn somewhere else when He alone is the ultimate answer? Please keep
that thought in mind as we go through our main point for tonight:
Jesus Christ is the ultimate answer to the concerns and questions in life of
those whom God has called to be part of His family.

What can we His followers learn about Jesus the ultimate answer?

**Jesus is the ultimate answer, so we His followers can rest in the power
and authority that God the Father gave to Him**

1. This happened after the Resurrection the goal of triumph over sin and
death had been achieved
2. The statement was meant to assuage the hesitant response of the
disciples in His presence (verse 17)
3. This authority was from God the Father (Matthew 11:27) and because
of the obedience of Christ dominion over all rule and authority had been
given to Him (Ephesians 1:20-21)
4. Because of that authority Jesus gives life and freedom to those whom
the Father has called to be His own (John 8:36, 10:14)
5. Those whom God has called have been freed by the death of Christ
on the cross and His resurrection. It is in His authority that the Father has
given Jesus that we are complete, not lacking anything, and we can find
satisfaction and joy in life.

**Jesus is the ultimate answer, so we as His followers are commanded to
proclaim what He has done to those around us**
1. The power and authority given to Jesus allows us to go out and share
what He has done
2. We are to go and proclaim the foundation of the Christian life, this is the
heart of the Gospel of Christ
	* Go – Reflect the Lordship and glory of Jesus Christ wherever we go
since the whole point is to make disciples of all nations
	* Make disciples – Bring them to be followers of Christ in speech and
in their life
	* Baptizing them – Sealing them as part of God’s covenant that they
belong to God
	* Teaching them to obey what Jesus has commanded – Encourage
them to grow in Christlikeness through catechisms and studying the
Word of God. This is what’s always forgotten, that it’s not just enough
that they know Christ... they have to live as followers of Christ

3. It is not enough to be just followers of Christ. We have to share to the
world that we belong to Christ. God in His faithfulness can use our lives
to encourage others in the journey of Christlikeness. For those who serve,
are we encouraging others through our lives and testimony?

**Jesus is the ultimate answer, so we as His followers are assured of His
presence and protection**
1. He assured His disciples that He will be there until the end of the age
2. The comfort of His presence and protection will not just enable us to face
the challenges of each day; it enables us to boldly proclaim who Jesus is
3. It is the assurance for us to make our lives a daily testimony of His grace
and faithfulness, because He has and will always be faithful

So, to recap:
1. Jesus is the ultimate answer, so we, His followers, are able to live every
day in the authority that God the Father gave to Him (verse 18)
2. Jesus is the ultimate answer, so we as His followers are commanded to
proclaim what He has done to those around us (verse 19 and 20)
3. Jesus is the ultimate answer, so we as His followers are assured of His
presence and protection (verse 20)

Christ as your ultimate answer means you surrender your life, your attitudes,
your concerns, your weaknesses... everything... to the loving and gracious God.
And not only that... when you have done so, share it. Proclaim it. Let people
see that there is a God who is greater than you or I can ever imagine, on whom
we must stand firm. And if you’re scared? Remember, He will never leave you
nor forsake you. Hold on to that promise, as you must tell others about the only
true Answer in our life, our Lord and Savior, our Rock of Ages, Jesus Christ.
