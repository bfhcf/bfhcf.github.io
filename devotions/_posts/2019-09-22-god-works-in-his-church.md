Who is leading the true church? Who is leading BFHCF?

Is it the consistory? Is it the ministry heads? Is it the ministers of the Word? 
None of the above.

It is God in Christ who is leading His true church.

In what ways is God leading His Church? God leads His church in many ways and for some we will learn in our text 2 Thessalonians 1, our text for this week.
        
For the month of September, our book of study is Thessalonians. Last Sunday, Pastor Jeff preached on 1 Thessalonians 5, the last chapter of the epistle. Today, we continue with 2 Thessalonians, starting  with chapter 1.

As we learned earlier as we studied 1 Thessalonians, the church was founded by Paul, Silas and Timothy during Paul’s second missionary journey at about the year 51 in the city of Thessalonica, a very progressive commercial Roman city. As we learn in Acts 17, the Apostle Paul, upon reaching the city, went to the synagogue and preached Jesus Christ. Some Jews and gentiles in the city believed and accepted Christ, joined them and founded the church. But, very shortly, the Jews became jealous. They called a mob to disturb the church. The Jews with the mob accused Paul and company of preaching a king, Jesus Christ, other than Caesar, then the king of Rome. The mob tried to apprehend Paul, Silas and Timothy in the house of Jason, one of the converts. Paul and company were not in the house so they were not caught. That night, Paul and company left immediately to avoid being harmed. They proceeded with their journey, but Paul was deeply concerned about the continuing persecution of the church.  When they reached Athens, Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to check on the condition of the church. When Timothy returned, he reported to Paul that the church remained faithful to the Lord but still being persecuted by the society and invaded with false teachings. Paul sent his first letter to the Thessalonians, which we studied for the last 5 Sundays.  While Paul was in Corinth in continuation of his second missionary journey, a few days after writing his first letter, he received some news about the condition of the church both good and bad. He was pleased and anxious even more. He wrote them 2 Thessalonians. 

Today, we start our study of 2 Thessalonians with its first chapter where Paul continued encouraging and teaching them further about what God is working the church.

What are these encouragements and teaching about what God is working the Church which Paul wrote the Thessalonians as well us, the church today and us in BFHCF?       


**I.	GOD WORKS THROUGH PAUL VV1,2**  
_2 Thessalonians 1:1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy,
To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 2 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._ 

As in all the letters of the Apostle Paul in the scripture, he always identified himself as the writer. He identifies himself as the writer of the 2nd letter to the Thessalonians. He included his fellow missionaries who accompanied him to Thessalonica - Silvanus or Silas and Timothy. He first greeted the recipient church in his letters, in this instance, the Thessalonian church. He greeted the church edifying them very affectionately. 

The Apostle Paul is greeting all churches today, including BFHCF.

We likewise must greet each other, edifying each one affectionately.
	
The apostle Paul affirmed to the church of Thessalonica, and all churches, that they are in God, the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. They were mystically joined to God, the Father and to the Lord, Jesus Christ.
        Likewise, this affirms that our church, BFHCF, composing all worshipers and members, is in God, the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. We are mystically joined to God, the Father and to our Lord Jesus Christ as well.

**A. What does it mean that the church is in God, the Father?** 

It means that the church belongs to the family of God, whose head is God, the Father, our Father. Paul affirms that there is an intimate Father and child relationship between God and the church, all who belong to Christ. God is their Father and they are His children. As heavenly Father, God cares, sustains and protects His children, His family, the church much more than earthly fathers. Some earthly fathers may lead their children to sin but our Heavenly Father always leads us away from sin and temptation. The church and any of Her members can relate and call God, the Father, intimately, ask anything according to His will and God, being their Father would answer them, give them what they need for their good, not necessarily what they ask for.

Likewise, we in BFHCF, God in heaven is our Father, protecting, caring and sustaining us for our good endlessly as members of His family for His glory.

**B. Further, what does it mean that church is in the Lord Jesus Christ?** 
It means that God in the person of Jesus Christ is our master. In Matthew, 28:18, after His resurrection and just as He was to rise to heaven, Christ proclaimed the truth “All authority has been given to me in heaven and earth.” He is the ruler of the whole creation, the whole of the universe, the whole of the earth. He is leading those whom the Father gave Him to be like Him. He is leading us, His people, along the path of righteousness fit for the kingdom of God. 
     When Christ was truly man in the flesh on earth, He demonstrated that he perfectly obeyed the Father. He was sinless. He was perfectly righteous. Christ who is now in heaven is in authority of heaven and earth. He is our sufficiency. He is our everything. He is our Lord.
We must obey Him in everything.
Truly, Jesus Christ is our Lord and master.
Further,

**C. The church was given grace and peace from the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. v2**

Grace and peace are essences of Christianity.

**Grace is undeserved favor.** The greatest grace is the grace from God. Yes, parents give grace to their children by caring for them despite being ungrateful. Some are gracious for loving the unlovable. But truly, the greatest grace is the grace from God.

Why?

We humans are sinful, enemies of God, not deserving anything, only His wrath. But God while we were still sinners, God, the Father, by His grace, sent God the Son, Jesus Christ to die for us the death that we deserve and saved us. The greatest grace is Jesus Christ dying for us, saving us, giving us eternal lives, us, the underserving sinners. 

And so, in Christ, we who believe Him and received Him, have peace with God. He died for us to pay the penalty for our sins which we cannot pay. All our sins are fully forgiven, our sins in the past, now and in the future. We are no longer guilty before God. We are fully justified. We are now at peace with God. And because we have peace with God, we can have peace with others, even with our enemies. We can have peace with ourselves. 

Truly, God works in the Apostle Paul to clarify the truth.
Further,

**II.	GOD WORKS THE PROGRESS OF THE CHURCH. VV 3,4.**  
_2Thess. 1:3. We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater
4 therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure._ 

**A.	   ALWAYS GIVE THANKS TO GOD. V3.**  

The word “ought” connotes obligation. Paul was obliged to thank God. He was obliged not only once, not only twice, but always, every time for the Thessalonians. 
Why was Paul obliged?

Paul was obliged to thank God in prayer, not only once or twice but always because God continued to do good for the Thessalonians. God is always good to His people, so his people ought to thank God in prayer always. 

**B.	The Thessalonian church was persecuted. V4b**
The church was persecuted for believing that Jesus Christ is sovereign in everything, their Lord of all. 

Why were they persecuted for submitting to Christ as Lord?, 

The church of Thessalonica was persecuted for believing that Jesus Christ is the Lord because the citizens of Thessalonica who were then part of the Roman Empire were then under the subjection of King Nero. Those belonging to the Roman empire submit only to King Nero and to no one else. Believing in Christ Jesus as the only Lord of all over the rule of King Nero was a crime against the law of the land. For these, the Thessalonians were persecuted, resulting to their suffering. In addition, the Jews were also teaching them to still observe the practices of the Old testament rituals. 

But despite their persecution, and consequent sufferings and exposure to false teachings,

**C.	The Thessalonian church remained faithful to the Lord in their persecution.  V4a**

God is not the author of trials and sufferings in the lives of His people. The word of God says so. For one, James 1:12,13 witnesses, “12 Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.

Suffering is a part of living in this world. While we Christians are not of the world we are in the world with evil. Everyone born in this world experiences suffering in one or in many of the various ways. 

Suffering is caused by the evil one or 
by body deterioration due to
unhealthy or sinful living, like getting HIV through
      promiscuity. 
or, natural consequence of aging, like the heart 
      just stops beating because of long work. 
or, by natural calamities, like in typhoons,
     earthquakes, even road accidents,
or self infliction like taking drugs while knowing
     that if is harm to body and mind.

God feels the pain of suffering of His people as witnessed in Isaiah 63:9, “During all their distress it was distressing to Him.”

God allows suffering of His people but He is with them in their sufferings.
For instance, The word in in 1 Corinthians 10:13 witnesses, “No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it. 

God allows suffering of His people but only what they can bear. He even enables His people to endure or overcome their suffering.

**GOD INCREASES THE FAITH OF THE SUFFERING**

God used the sufferings inflicted by the persecutors in increasing and growing the faith of the Thessalonians. 
Truly, the Lord uses suffering and persecution to increase faith more than when they are comfortable. 
Indeed, when people are too materially comfortable, overly sufficient in their physical lives, they forget about their spiritual needs which is the better side of life. They even forget that all the material things that they have is owned by God who created everything. They feel self-sufficient; they feel self-reliant; they are self -centered. They do not feel the need for God. Some say there is no God. Some say they are like God. Some say they are better than God. Indeed, in many instances, too much comfort leads man to go away from God leading them to destruction and spiritual death. 

However, if we are comfortable, we must thank God because our comfort comes from Him. Every good comes from God. In our comfort, we must also depend on God.

But truly, in many instances, especially those touched by God, it is when people are away from their comfort zone, when they suffer that they recognize and feel their incapability and insufficiency. When we Christians suffer, when we are helpless, we recognize our need for supernatural help, help which the world cannot give. We turn more to God. We want to know Him more. We pray more. We fellowship with Him more. We read the word more. We obey more. We truly feel the peace of God. We learn to trust God more. We grow in faith more. We truly recognize and feel His sovereignty and love.

Truly, in many instances, we Christians grow in faith in suffering and trials more than in comfort.   

As the Thessalonians grew in faith, they also grew in love. Likewise, as we are growing in faith, we also

**GROW IN LOVE v3b**  
Love is the first and the greatest command of God. Jesus says in Matthew 22:37-40, And He said to him, " 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'  38 "This is the great and foremost commandment.  39 "The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'  40 "On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets."

What is love?
Love is defined in the Bible, one in 1 Cor 13:4-7. 4 Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, 5 does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,  6 does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

In suffering, the Thessalonian church grew in faith and in love. 

In suffering we also grow in faith and in love. 
However, we do not have to suffer to grow in faith and in love. We can grow spiritually, grow to Christ-likeness by submitting completely to the Lord, read and internalize the Word of God and obey in the power of the Holy Spirit.

Truly, God works in the spiritual progress of the church, likewise

**III.	GOD WORKS THE PRESERVATION OF THE SAINTS vv 5-10**

v5. This is a plain indication of God's righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering. 

6 For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, 7 and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, 8 dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
9 These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 10 when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed — for our testimony to you was believed. 

**A.	   God is just. v 5**

1.	He blesses the righteous. V5

God is perfectly just. He commits no error in His judgement. He acts perfectly according His law, rule and standard as the sovereign of the universe.
God set the standard for those who goes to His Kingdom, those who will be raised with Christ at His coming. 
      God used the persecution of the Thessalonians to increase their faith in Christ and love for God and neighbor to prepare them and make them fit in the kingdom of God and at the coming of Christ.
       Likewise, God is always working in us to grow to be like Christ. While on earth in this corrupted body, we will never grow to become perfect in Christ. While we are living on earth, we remain work in process. But God, in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit is working in us to grow fit for the kingdom. 

We must submit to God’s work in making us fit for the kingdom.

Further, 

2. God is just, He punishes the unrighteous. V6,8-10

In the justice of God according to His law, the unrighteous are punished. They are responsible for their punishment for not believing and receiving Jesus Christ.

Psalm 34:21 affirms, “Evil shall slay the wicked. And those who hate the righteous will be condemned.” 
    Paul witnessed to the Thessalonian church that their persecutors who were making them suffer for believing Christ, the unbelievers, the unrighteous, the wicked, will suffer the wrath of God. They will be punished with eternal damnation in hell.

Truly, in His justice, God works in the preservation of the saints but punishes the unbelievers with eternal suffering.

At the end of the chapter, Paul prays for the Thessalonians

**IV.	INTERCESSORY PRAYER FOR PERFECTION VV 11,12**

_vv11. To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power, 12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ._

Prayer is essential in Christian life. We children of God are commanded to pray always. Even Jesus Christ while He was in the flesh prayed frequently. The Apostle Paul prayed always, praying for the church. We are urged to pray always, without ceasing as well. In our prayer we are urged to 

**A.	  Intercede for our fellow believers. V11**

Paul prayed for the Thessalonian church interceding for them to continue living in faith to be worthy of their calling unto their salvation.
      Likewise, in many parts of the scripture, we too are commanded to pray for one another. For one James 5:16b, tells us to “pray for one another, that you may be healed”.

**B.	All these for the** 
GLORIFY GOD ALWAYS.  

**CONCLUSION:**

**SUMMARY:**
The church maybe faced with various trials but God is always working for her good purpose.
1.	God, in Christ, works through Paul in building the church. 
2.	God, in Christ, works in the progress of the church.
3.	God, in Christ, works in the preservation of the saints.
4.	God, in Christ, works in our prayers.

**APPLICATION:**  
Many Christians say that to be one is difficult. To be a righteous minority in an unrighteous world is difficult.  For being a true Christian, many suffer ridicule, many suffer persecution, many suffer trials. 
But let us Christians be assured; God is in us. God is in us who were chosen of God, who believe and receive Jesus Christ, who are children of God born of the Spirit. We thank God for using as His instrument the Apostle Paul in teaching us the truth about God. God is truly good. By His power and sovereignty, He is working to accomplish His purpose for the church, which is to bring His church to Himself, in Christ Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit. He is working for the growth of the church and for the preservation of the saints. He instituted prayer so that we have intimate relationship with Him. Let us therefore submit totally to God, our Father, in Christ Jesus our Lord and the Holy Spirit, our counsellor, all for the glory of God. As He promises, God works in BFHCF, enabling the church to accomplish His purpose. Let us all join obeying Him, participating in the various ministries of the church, especially in pursuing the thrust of the Church which God gave which is “TO MAKE JESUS KNOWN” and “MAKE OUR FAMILIES ONE IN CHRIST”,

ALL FOR THE GLORY OF GOD.
