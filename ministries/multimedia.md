The Multimedia Ministry comprises a vibrant and diverse team of individuals who are passionate about serving and worshipping God through various forms of media. We firmly believe that age and background should not limit one's ability to serve, as we recognize that every individual has a unique contribution to make. With the grace of God and under His guidance, we humbly embrace the call to service and continually strive to center our focus on the Lord, finding joy and fulfillment in our worshipful acts of service.

The Multimedia Ministry has four arms or tracks:
1. The Print and Digital Media Team produces visual collaterals for the
weekly fellowship news, ministry announcements and activity posters.
2. The Worship Team aids our preachers and worship leaders in services
through the provision of slides and presentations.
3. The Documentation Team takes charge of photo and video coverages of
different church events and services.
4. The Website and Social Media Management Team maintains and designs
our Church website and updates the content in our social media accounts.

Our ministry has a clear vision: to worship and honor God by utilizing various media platforms for ministry. We aim to foster a sense of fellowship, collaboration, and spiritual growth within the BFHCF community. With God's grace and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we aspire to extend our reach beyond the church premises and proclaim the Gospel to communities through the power of media.

To fulfill our vision, we are actively working on strengthening our training and discipleship efforts. This includes organizing Bible studies, workshops, and offering one-on-one mentoring opportunities. With the help of our Lord, we seek to inspire and encourage church members to engage in worship and service through our ministry.

If you feel called by God to serve in the Multimedia Ministry, we warmly invite you to approach our dedicated ministry core team. We believe that together, we can fulfill our mission of using media to glorify God and make a positive impact on the lives of others.
