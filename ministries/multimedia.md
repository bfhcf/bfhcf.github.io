The Multimedia Ministry is a dynamic group of individuals with a heart to serve and worship through different forms of media. We believe that service knows no age or background, and by the grace and leading of God, we acknowledge the call to service and continuously seek and focus on the Lord for the joy and the heart of worshipful service.
By the grace and guidance of our Lord, we are praying to continue to encourage the members of the church to worship and serve God through this ministry.

## Vision
Our vision is to build up the kingdom of God and carry the Gospel of Jesus Christ to our visually-driven, constantly changing world and present it in such a way all ages and nations will understand.

## Mission
As a ministry, we exist to worship and glorify God by ministering through the different platforms of media; to nurture fellowship, collaboration and spiritual growth among the members of the BFHCF community; and by the grace of God and leading of the Holy Spirit, reach out and proclaim the Gospel to communities outside the church grounds as itâ€™s broadcasted or distributed on our media platforms with the highest video, audio, and production quality available.

Our ministry is structured into five primary arms:
1. **Creative Team**: This team crafts visually appealing materials such as posters and announcements to effectively promote our church events.
2. **Worship Team**: Supporting preachers and worship leaders with slides and presentations during services to enhance the worship experience and convey God's message effectively.
3. **Documentation Team**: Capturing precious moments in our church life through photos and videos, preserving memories, and ensuring access through live streaming.
4. **Website and Social Media Team**: Maintaining our user-friendly church website and managing our social media accounts to stay connected with our congregation and the wider community.
5. **Recruitment Team**: Responsible for welcoming new volunteers and equipping existing ones.

Each of these tracks plays a pivotal role in the success of our ministry.
