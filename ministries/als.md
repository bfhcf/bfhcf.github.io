**Vision:**  
To improve individual self-worth and productivity.

**Mission:**  
To provide basic and functional literacy skills, knowledge, and
values to the out-of-school children, youth and adults, and to improve their
quality of life, family, and community.

Our government has strong programs for the out-of-school population and one
of them is the ALTERNATIVE LEARNING SYSTEM. BFHCF is a provider of the
system and is in partnership with the Department of Education-Las Piñas City.

In line with the mission of our church to “transform communities in the
Philippines,” we reach out to the out-of-school children, youth and adults
who have not finished basic formal education and we teach this population
the system that is an alternate or substitute to formal education.

The Governance Act for Basic Education, otherwise known as the Republic Act
9155, stipulates the establishment of the Alternative Learning System (ALS) to
provide out-of-school children, youth and adults population with basic education.

Based on the 2017 Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS), about nine
percent of the estimated 39.2 million Filipinos aged 6-24 years old were
out-of-school children and youth (OSCY). Though according to DepEd
officials, the number of this population has decreased partly due to the
implementation of the Senior High School and the strengthening of DepEd’s
incentives to support school attendance i.e. continuing its feeding program,
tuition subsidies programs, and Alternative Learning System.

ALS is practical, informal and works in a mode that fits the distinct situations
and needs of the learners including their families and communities. The system
provides them with basic and functional literacy skills, knowledge and values
including adults who are over-age for the regular schools and are less-privileged
to complete their elementary or secondary courses. Upon completion of ALS
(Junior High School), the OSC, OSY and OSA will get an elementary or high
school diploma and eventually find jobs to improve their quality of life.

We believe that God has designed our church to help the out-of-school
population not only in their educational needs but most especially in their
spiritual lives. Our ALS approach is spiritually inspired. We integrate God’s
Word in our teaching, allot one hour every Saturday afternoon for teaching
“Spiritual Journey to Christlikeness,” and encourage our learners to join the
Youth or Adult Worship.
