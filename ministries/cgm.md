We are CGM: Happy inside out!

CGM, or the Church Greeters Ministry, is in the process of recruiting members.
Calling all BFHCF members who are energetic, dedicated and willing to be
trained: this is now the opportunity to serve our God!

**Vision:**  
We are a group of Church Greeters who are mindful of our role as
gatekeepers and are willing to personify BFHCF as a welcoming congregation.

**Mission:**  
CGM is here to glorify God by ushering, promoting orderliness, and
exhibiting a warm and positive impact to the body of Christ.
Soon, we will conduct a second assembly to meet the new batch of CGM.
Those interested to join, please contact Sister Karren Dilao at 0926-006-3433 or
Deaconess Grace Isip at 0925-788-1122.
