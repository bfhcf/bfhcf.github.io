The Praise and Worship Ministry is rooted in a deep reverence for God's sovereignty and grace. Our vision is to create an environment in which worshipers profoundly experience the manifest presence of God during every worship service, leading them to a deeper and more intimate relationship with Him.

Our mission is to provide a worship atmosphere through music that aligns with the divine movement of the Holy Spirit, the illumination of God's Word, and the ultimate glorification of God. Through this mission, we aspire to encourage, edify, and empower worshipers for the work of the Lord in our church and community, recognizing that it is God's divine plan that guides our endeavors.

Age is not a limiting factor within our music ministry. We believe that anyone who feels called by God and possesses the desire to serve is welcome to join us. Together, let us unite our voices and instruments in worship, magnifying the Lord and Savior through the powerful medium of music, understanding that it is God's grace that has brought us together.

The music ministry holds a central and vital role within our church, harmonizing with the core principles of our faith. It serves to uplift believers, complement the preaching of the Word, and foster unity among the congregation. Through harmonious melodies and heartfelt lyrics, we collectively offer our worship, all to glorify the sovereignty and grace of God.

As stewards of this ministry, we are dedicated to nurturing the spiritual growth of our members, recognizing that God's grace is at work in their lives. Our CARE activities, including our Quarterly Fellowship, proposed Mentor-Mentee program, and the Music Intensive Training (MINT), are designed to cultivate not only musical proficiency but also a deeper understanding of God's providence.

Indeed, we serve a God who is sovereign and gracious, worthy of all our praises. In unity and devotion, we strive to bring glory to His name, acknowledging that it is His sovereignty and grace that shape our worship and our lives, and rejoicing in the profound relationship we share with Him.
